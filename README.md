# TheBaldRule

[The bald-haired rule](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D1%8B%D1%81%D1%8B%D0%B9_%E2%80%94_%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%B9) is a political "rule" which determines reign order of Russia state rulers. This small project 
uses Pytorch code to leverage a small convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images of people to bald and non-bald persons, 
thus, predicting the chances of a man to become the next president of Russian Federation.
