# TheBaldRule

[The bald/hairy rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald%E2%80%93hairy) is a political "rule" which determines reign order of Russia state rulers. This small project 
uses Pytorch code to leverage a small convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images of people to bald and non-bald persons, 
thus, predicting the chances of a man to become the next president of Russian Federation.
