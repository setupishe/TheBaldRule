# TheBaldRule

The bald-haired is a political "rule" which determines reign order of Russia state rulers. This small project 
uses Pytorch code to leverage a small convolutional neural network (CNN) for classifying images of people to bald and non-bold persons, 
thus, predicting the chances of a man to become the next president of Russian Federation.
